# BUGSCOUT: AI-Powered Code Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview
BUGSCOUT is a web-based platform designed to simplify security checks by automatically detecting and analyzing vulnerabilities in source code. By combining a no-code/low-code builder with an open-source Large Language Model (LLM), BUGSCOUT makes vulnerability detection accessible for both developers and non-technical stakeholders.

## Core Components & Workflow

### Frontend/UI
- **File Upload:** Users can upload individual source files or ZIP archives of their project.
- **Analyze Code:** A single click on the "Analyze Code" button initiates the vulnerability scanning process.

### Backend/Orchestration
- **File Handling:** Uploaded files are received, decompressed if necessary, and split into manageable code chunks to adhere to LLM token limits.
- **Vulnerability Analysis:** Each code chunk is sent to an open-source LLM (via API or local hosting) which detects potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Result Aggregation:** The findings are compiled into a comprehensive vulnerability report.

### Reporting
- **Display:** Vulnerability details—including line numbers, descriptions, and recommended fixes—are displayed on the BUGSCOUT interface.
- **Optional Features:** Users may export reports as PDF files or receive them via Slack/email integrations.

## Choice of Open-Source LLM
- **Recommended Options:** StarCoder, Code Llama, or SantaCoder are ideal for code-centric tasks.
- **Initial Setup:** BUGSCOUT will begin with Hugging Face's Inference API to simplify integration and avoid complex local hosting.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Frontend Development**
   - Build the user interface in Bolt.diy.
   - Integrate a file upload widget and an "Analyze Code" trigger.

2. **Backend Development**
   - Handle file inputs, decompress archives, and split large files as needed.
   - Ensure that code chunks are properly formatted for LLM processing.

3. **LLM Analysis**
   - Send each code chunk to the selected open-source LLM with a prompt instructing it to detect vulnerabilities, explain them, and suggest fixes.
   - Receive and parse the LLM's output, preferably in a structured format (e.g., JSON).

4. **Results Aggregation & Display**
   - Merge all individual LLM responses into a single report.
   - Display the final report on a user-friendly dashboard in BUGSCOUT.

## Beginner-Friendly Tips
- **Start Small:** Validate the process using a single-file scan before scaling to entire projects.
- **Token Limit Awareness:** Keep code snippets within token limits to ensure effective LLM processing.
- **UI Simplicity:** Design a clean and clear user interface with straightforward instructions.
- **Disclaimer:** Remember that while AI-based scanning is powerful, manual review is still necessary as the system might miss or misidentify vulnerabilities.

## Demo Strategy
1. **Example Project:** Demonstrate the tool using a small application or code snippet with known vulnerabilities (e.g., hardcoded credentials, potential SQL injection points).
2. **Live Upload & Analysis:** Show the end-to-end process—from file upload and processing to real-time vulnerability detection.
3. **(Optional) Automatic Fix:** Optionally, illustrate how BUGSCOUT can suggest improved code or generate a safer version of a risky function.
